<h1>COVID-19 Pandemic and the Role of Vaccinations
<br>A Cross-Country Comparative Analysis</h1>

<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has been at the forefront of international news, affecting all countries with differing levels of severity. The following analysis presents the brief overview of the global pandemic and vaccination progress. In order to maintain a balanced and objective evaluation, the focus was put on two economically contrasting countries, the United Kingdom and Kenya. The in-depth comparison investigates which country turned out to be more affected by COVID-19 and which response was more effective.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
The following git hub repository contains following files:
<ul>
<li>Data folder – with 2 datasets (country_vaccinations.csv, worldometer_coronavirus_daily_data.csv)</li>
<li>Output folder – containing relevant summary data frames for global overview, vaccination and country specific information</li>
<li>Images folder – containing all of the visualisations included in the analysis</li>
<li>5 Jupyter Notebooks containing data analytics for global overview, vaccination summary, combined UK and Kenya analysis and country specific analysis</li>
<li>Presentation file – slide deck containing analysis visuals and summary</li>
<li>Requirements.txt – document containing the list of the python libraries used throughout the analysis</li>
</ul>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>The analysis was conducted fully using Python and was based on two datasets – ‘Country Vaccination’ and ‘Worldometer Coronavirus Daily Data’. During the analysis some of the datasets’ limitations and disparities were identified. The first dataset splits the United Kingdom into constituent countries and provides specific data for each of them. To maintain the precision and relevancy of the comparison, some manipulation was necessary. A separate data frame was created for each country and then merged on date to create a combined dataset for the United Kingdom with the ability to still view the change over time. 
A variety of Python libraries was used throughout the project. Most of the work was done using Pandas, Matpolotlib and Geopandas. The Pandas library was used for displaying and cleaning the dataset, identifying and pulling out relevant data, creating new data frames and merging the existing ones. Once the summary statistics were generated, the visualisations were created using Matplotlib and Geopandas.</p>
